# Wikipedia-Web-Scraper-With-Python
In this project, I used Python and Pandas to scrape data from a Wikipedia page on the largest U.S. companies by revenue. I extracted key information such as rank, name, industry, revenue, growth, employees, and headquarters, and saved it into a CSV file for analysis, demonstrating my data collection skills.
